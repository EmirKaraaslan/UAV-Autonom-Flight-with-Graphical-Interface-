UAV Autonom Flight with Graphical Interface 


In this project ı have designed a graphical interface to manage  UAV's route in terms of GPS statuts(Latitude, Longtitude , Altitude) 
only think that you need is right click on map and set target where you'd like to go.ı have used dronekit lib for communucation between GCS(Ground Control System) and the UAV , this lib is working on MAVPROXY, technically you need to deploy an MAVlink or MAVPROXY externally or just use MissonPlanner. Thanks for tkintermapview lib you can use this system on tkinter GUI's easily.
